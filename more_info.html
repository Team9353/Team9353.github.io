                        <p>
                          Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors,
                          which would have been pack hunters with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of
                          social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and
                          ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given
                          dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful
                          species on the planet today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The dogs&#x27; value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous
                          across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling
                          loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding
                          handicapped individuals. This impact on human society has given them the nickname
                          &quot;man&#x27;s best friend&quot; in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are
                          also a source of meat.
